Technical Debt:
Example 1:
    When we copy paste the code for new bike Vaiant , in some places missed to adapt the new bike requirements.( For example instead of displaying the new bike image still showing the old bike image)
Example 2:
    When the requirements are explicit , writing the code with assumptions and taking the old variant as reference . And in the end once defect is raised , went for customer confirmation which again turned as rework to change the implementation
