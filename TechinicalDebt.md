Technical Debt:

Example 1:
    When we copy paste the code for new bike Vaiant , in some places missed to adapt the new bike requirements.( For example instead of displaying the new bike image still showing the old bike image)
This happened when we try to reuse the code and add the variant check whereever needed

Example 2:
    When the requirements are not explicit , writing the code with assumptions and taking the old variant as reference . And in the end once defect is raised , went for customer confirmation which again turned as rework to change the implementation

Causes:
Time Constraint
Poor communication

Symptoms:
Frequent Bugs
